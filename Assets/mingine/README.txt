Agnostic to platform and top-down
Salvage all cool things from previous projects into components, lots of small tasks

levels - 
  custom save/load (more generic than now) or duplicated template scene that loads managers (smells like trouble if prefabs change etc?)

Buy some sprites to include?

Demos
  N++ coloring
  Horde engine remake (tons of bullets, some lighting, looked and felt pretty great)
  Things I can salvage

Particles as weapon projectiles, test large amounts
 programatically?
 Recreate horde engine demo with particles. If possible. Can the lighting be done too?

Tilemap pills + triggered bombs 

Playfab integration?
