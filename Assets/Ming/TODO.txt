   IMPL:
     LightSources, paint light into this layer: Vector4[] - RGB + expireTime.
     CurrentLight: vector3[]
   light sources paint on a light layer
   light blur like Terraria, spread as fast as possible.
   light slowly decays (how does this mix with the blur?)

   "light-staff": throw light globes to light up areas, uses mana

Random ideas:
  crafting without the hassle
    infini-chest: all materials can be auto-dropped here and there is unlimited room.
    crafting automatically uses infini-chest resources.
    decreasing life in the dark
    easy to paint light, but it's dark when you go back :p Mana for mining, shooting and lighting. You have to pick.

  MINING-GUN! Pickaxes are for... pickaxers. Shoot to mine!!

  flow maps leads to ore, minions bring ore to home (another flowmap)

  ORIGINAL: minesweeper, add numbers on top of cells, COULD LEAD TO TREASURE OR DANGER! Actually pretty cool.
   (oh the pun... MINE...)
   multiplayer sounds fun
    - if the engine is any good this should be an "easy" demo

  minions: HIDE! move to home and... something... Return: back to mining.

two globals to "fix":
                Horde.Sprites.AddQuad(pos, p.LightSize, p.RotationDegrees, p.LightSize.y, p.LightColor, p.LightSprite, p.LightMaterial, _lightLayer);
            }
        }

        void OnEnable() { Horde.ComponentUpdater.RegisterForUpdate(this, MingUpdatePass.Internal_DrawMeshes); }


sprite sorting (I used that in editor in Ghouls?)

rotationDegrees is not used in this:
        public void AddQuad(Vector3 center, Vector2 size, float rotationDegrees, float zSkew, Vector2 uvTopLeft, Vector2 uvSize, Color32 color)


is is not used:
        public MingBatchRenderer(ulong id, Texture texture, Material material, int layer, int quadsPerMesh)



Pixel dudes sprite sheet:

0: static
1-4: idle
